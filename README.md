# Movement-Parabolic-with-First-Person-Camera-Game-Assets-Unity-3d-
Inspired by the dynamic game Severed Steel, we've recreated its smooth movement and encapsulated it into a set of easily integrable tools for any Unity 3D project.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dotween tool is required to achieve a clean interpolation. If you don't have it, you can get it [here](https://pages.github.com/](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676)https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676).
> If you want to try the compiled mechanics you can do so by visiting [here](https://jesusdvs.itch.io/movement-parabolic).
