# Movement-Parabolic-with-First-Person-Camera-Game-Assets-Unity-3d-
Inspired by the dynamic game Severed Steel, we've recreated its smooth movement and encapsulated it into a set of easily integrable tools for any Unity 3D project.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dotween tool is required to achieve a clean interpolation. If you don't have it, you can get it [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676).

If you want to try the compiled mechanics you can do so by visiting [here](https://jesusdvs.itch.io/movement-parabolic).
## How to integrate it into your personal project

1. First, clone the repository into your YourProject/Assets/ directory.
2. Next, navigate to the YourProject/Assets/Movement-Parabolic-with-First-Person-Camera-Game-Assets-Unity-3d-/ciberv2/Scenes folder.
3. Finally, you can open the SampleSceneCiber scene and explore all the objects.
4. To use it in your own scene, you can turn the Player object into a prefab.
5. Remember to set the layers as follows: Layer 6: Ground, 7: NoCross, or you can choose your preferred layer - make sure to check the Inspector carefully.
